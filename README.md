* key up -> temporary engine start: perpendicular direction
* key right/left -> temporary engine start: perpendicular direction but at the engine point
* key r -> creating a new drone that can be controlled but without removing the old one

* key r should delete the old drone
* improvement physics
* converting control from event to functions
* under the influence of high force, the walls let the objects pass
